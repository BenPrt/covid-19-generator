# My React-Redux App template

This repository contains my favorite React-Redux project set-up.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
The app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run lint`

Lint the application, based on Facebook internal ESLint configuration

### `npm run start:heroku`

Build the application in production mode, then execute a server that runs it.
It's the command run by Heroku when the app is deployed
